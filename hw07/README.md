## 1-Wire Temperature Sensors
See read1wires.sh for the bash file that reads all three temperature sensors from P9_14 and prints to the terminal values in farenheit.

## systemd
The file flask.service is the service file I made to run my flask client automatically once the bone reboots. The flask service runs the file app4.py which lets you control a led on pin P8_12 using the flask server.
