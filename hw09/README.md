## MAX31820 Temperature Sensors
See readW1Temp.py for this code. Using python, I read each MAX31820 temperature sensor and print their values in celsius to the terminal.

## Logging in Sheets
See demo.py for the code for this part. I read each of the three MAX31820 temperature sensors and plotted the data in the google sheets, its URL listed below. The code will run until you press control c, continually collecting data. <br>

Below you can see a screenshot of the plot produced from the collected data:

For this run, data was collected every 10 seconds. The spikes are from when I placed my finger on some of the sensors. I was recording this data inside in the Moench commons.
